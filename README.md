## Summary 
- Provided the input data structure is the same for future elections this script could be used to produce similar results. The only modification would be pointing the script to the proper files for input and output (file_to_load and file_to_save variables) 
- If the data structure where slightly different some modifications would be needed to map the columns in the input to a common format prior to running pointing the variables to the proper input and output files.
